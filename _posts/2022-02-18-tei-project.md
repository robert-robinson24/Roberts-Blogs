To begin my TEI project, I needed part of a story to cover. I ended up with a part of the story of Dracula, specifically a conversation between an English officer and his soldiers. He informed them not to say anything other than that they had seen a large dog. The soldiers complain that it wasn't even a dog, but rather a wolf. My part of the story ended with the soldiers going to their barracks and the main character going to Munich

The process of coding was overall pretty easy, which honestly made me even more nervous. When Professor Stover said we would be doing coding for our next project, I panicked. My experience with coding has been brief and unpleasant, so when we got around to this project I was on edge. But the first exercise we did made everything simplified. Instead of hacking mainframes and giving viruses, we went to Google Drive, followed a format and noted certain parts of the text. Things like em-dashes, new paragraphs, or new pages were highlighted. The simplicity of it cannot be understated; it made the transition to coding pretty easy. The exercise also made me notice the many subtleties of writing and how many parts of word structure is involved.

Looking at this now, I never expected to be able to write code to this extent. Looking at the sample that Professor Stover showed us, I was pretty intimidated. But we then were presented a tutorial of the coding we would be doing through our professor. Personally, I find it much easier to follow along when I can get a step-by-step process, and that's exactly what I got. The final result was a very pleasant surprise.

I am definitely not an expert, or even good at computers, but this project was very fun in that it pushed me out of my comfort zone and experience levels. It also made the process for coding much more simplified and made me appreciate coding even more.
