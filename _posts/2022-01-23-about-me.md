# About Me

Hi, My name is Robert Robinson and I am a sophomore at Christopher Newport University. I am currently studying Communications and Business, and I also play **rugby as well as indoor soccer here.** 

When I was younger, I grew up on a farm in Fredericksburg, and I lived with next to no social life until I was around ten. I have been homeschooled my entire life, and when I say I had I had no social life, for context, I didn't know what _basketball_ was until I was eleven. Naturally, I took to trying all new types of sports, with soccer in particular standing out to me. It was around this time I started to learn social skills, and more of what I wanted to do in life. 

After reaching high school level work, there wasn't much that interested me other than history and science. I liked exploring new things I hadn't tried before, such as marine behavior or statues in France dedicated to fallen horses from World War I. When I was sixteen, I did my first dual enrollment class in English 101, and in that class I learned a lot about how to be a more effective writer. But in the following semester, I took a English 102, and that professor taught me even more about creative writing and how to personalize writing while keeping it professional. Those two classes made me appreciate writing and how to be a a _better_ listener. 

I think one thing about me is that ever since I learned that not everyone lived on a farm and talked to more than just family members, I have _always_ been invested in exploring new things. From me playing rugby for the first time to going to Key West and doing other events and activities I've never done before, I'm invested in learning more about other and myself. I like to be able to find and solve issues that people come up with. I feel like me making the most of my experiences will help me in helping others with their problems. That is why I selected Communications as my major.

Part of the reason I picked this class was to fufill my Writing Intensive requirement for that major. I **also** picked it because I feel like it can help me be a better writer, and improve in organizing and formulating thoughts , just like my old English professors did.
