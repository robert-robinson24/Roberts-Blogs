To begin my TEI project, I needed part of a story to cover. I ended up with a part of the story of Dracula, specifically a conversation between an 
english officer and his soldiers. He informed them not to say anything other than that they had seen a large dog. The soldiers complain that it 
wasn't even a dog, but rather a wolf. My part of the story ended with the soldiers going to their barracks and the main character going to Munich

The process of coding was overall pretty easy, which honestly made me even more nervous.
