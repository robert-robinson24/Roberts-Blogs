The Pulter Project 

Wendy Wall, Leah Knight

**http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/**

The Pulter Project, the brief history of a poet along with her works are created by Leah Knight and Wendy Wall. Her name was Hester Pulter, and she was born in 1605. All of her work was in one book compilation in which a _lot_ of detail was preserved. From her pseudonym as **"Haddasah"** to the detail of her servants' wages to even the edits and spelling changes that she made. Her book was missing until it was found in 1975 and is currently with the Brotherton Library. Recently, her manuscript was added to the Perdita Project, followed by editions of other projects involving her poetry. The project also included all publications regarding Hester Pulter along with her work. 

In my opinion, overall the Project works well in terms of the content it presents. If the purpose of it was to give a brief but detailed lesson of both the author and her work, it seemed to perform it well. I never knew of Pulter or any of her work, but after reading through the Project, I have gotten a higher understanding of both. That isn't to say I have no issues with the Project. While there was a lot of effort that needed to be done to retrieve history, especially from that time period, it seems brief for so many people having worked on it.

Here, we can see Pulter's marriage. Already, we see conflicting reports. What I would suggest is that that Wall and Knight show more "receipts" of the reports. They mention in one of the poems that she was thirteen when she was married, but said in the preceding sentence that she was actually married when she was fifteen. I do appreciate Wall and Knight for bringing up _another_ time she changed her age. Towards the end of the Poet section, they mention how in one of her poems that she "rounded her age down."

All the links seem to be working fine on the site, which leads to another question as to why so many 
of them lead to the **same** page of the background of Hester Pulter and her poems. A few links are the exception to this, and they lead to the team that runs the project, 
how to cite the project, and one that talks about recent events involving Pulter's work.

Everything else goes to the same page. While I think it is intriguing to have all 
current publications of the author listed in one of the links, I do not see why that would be the most useful thing to research. I can see a lot of time was spent on researching the Project and a lot was found as a result. But for all the research uncovered, they spent most of the page talking about what they believed Pulter's life was like, but much less time utilizing the artifact they had. The researchers did not seem as focused on speaking about the book as they were about her. 

I believe it is important to not forget the author, but I think that if the main tool they could use to learn about her happened to be what the project was about they could have utilized it more. I think revealing all of the citations, along with where to find the original manuscript, could be Wall and Knight's way of saying that readers could find more information or context for themselves. But they gave some information on the page that had me personally wanting more about the book itself, such as if she collaborated with other poets or how many poems were in the book, or how long it took her to write. I have limited exposure in researching and critiquing new projects, but in my experience people will often do in text citations of what they are presenting. This was done multiple times on the page, but I feel it could have included imagery of the book. A lot of people like and appreciate visuals, so I would suggest including pictures of some of the poems they had, or more about Pulter. Like things Pulter would have liked, or worn, or more about her family. I think overall, though, this project is well done, especially in navigating the pages.
