In this class, I explored in depth the topic of Digital Humanities, something I was initially new to. My initial understanding of the topic was that it was the study of the effect of technology on society. While I would confidently stick with that interpretation, I have come to realize just how much can fall under that branch. I became familiar with many new words and phrases like jargon, peer review, and shitty first drafts, and this was the class where I *finally* learned how to tweet.

One of the first things I learned was, of course, **GitHub**. I had never used any site like it, and it took some time to figure it out. I remember asking my professor how to start a blog. It was initially frustrating when I wasn't even able to add a photograph correctly. But as time went along, I started to understand it. We completed multiple topics in the blogs, from talking about ourselves in a introductory blog to us reflecting on a computer coding project. I had done a computer science class prior to this semester, but what we had gone over was nothing like what we were about to do in class. I remember this being the highest point of my frustration in comprehending this subject. I cnouldn't wrap my head around how this in any way related to a writing class. I was frustrated that instead of writing papers talking about a book like I was used to in previous English classes, I was having to perfect an unfamiliar strain of English. It wasn't until I went over one of the first few slides early in the semester which visualized what topics could be considered Digital Humanities and why. After that point, everything clicked. The actual coding part of the project was broken down to the point where it became decreasingly daunting, and the only hard part was figuring out how to add the photos to the blog.

I think the second assignment I did prepared me for the final project a lot more than I would've expected. We looked through Digital Humanities projects and critiqued and analyzed them. I didn't know it then, but it was laying the groundwork for the final grant project. By having us going through the visual roadmaps, we were seeing how our grants would eventually look, provided our grant was approved. The only groundwork would be than to work backwards from what it would look like to the grant and seeing how the description would look in a perfect world. This touch made the process of writing out the project much easier, since we had a finalized Digital Humanities project as a frame of reference for ours. This was one of the minor details that made this class much more enjoyable. 

After the coding project, the final project of the semester didn't seem so bad. While grant proposals are an extension of English that I had never done before, I was facing it with more confidence than I had with other projects before. Just like the computer coding project, it was broken down in smaller steps that made it simpler to work with. I think for me, doing it with a partner helped a lot. Together, we were able to brainstorm a bunch of proposals for our professor, which she then critiqued and advised accordingly. After we narrowed it down to **Crime Families in New York,** everything became simple enough to complete. 

One of my biggest takeaways from this class is that there is a lot more to English than just writing papers. First coming into this class, I was expecting to just have a bunch of papers to write along with an occasional discussion post. When the class first started, I thought it would be a walk in the park and be a straightforward class. After the first week, I had no idea what this class was. I didn’t know what to expect or even how to work **GitHub.** I became lost in the class and had no idea what to do. But after it started to click, I learned to appreciate the class and what it meant to me. I didn’t know or think much of Digital Humanities prior to this semester. But now, after all the projects and other ways of learning about it, I have come to understand the subject. Seeing how Digital Humanities can be impactful to the culture has changed my view of it, and I have learned just how broad English can be.
