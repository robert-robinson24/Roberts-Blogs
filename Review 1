The Pulter Project, the brief history of a poet along with her works are shown. Her name was Hester Pulter, and she was born in 1605. 
All her work was in one book compilation in which a _lot_ of detail was preserved. From her pseudonym as Haddasah to the detail of her sevants' wages to even the edits and spelling changes that she made. 
Her book was missing until it was found in 1975 and are currently with the Brotherton Library. Recently, her manuscript was added to the Perdita Project, follwed by editions of fragments of her compilation. 
The project also included all publications regarding Hester Pulter along with her work. 

In my opinion, overall the Project works well in terms of the content it presents. If the purpose of it was to give an daetailed but brief lesson of both the author and her work,
it seemed to handle it well. I never knew of Pulter or any of her work, but after reading through the Project, I have gotten a higher understanding of both. 
That isnt to say I have no issues with the Project. While there was a lot of effort that needed to be done to retrieve history, especially from that time period, 
it still seems brief for so many people having worked on it. It seems to be an ongoing Project, which hopefully will lead to more information. That said however, 
what information they do have is essientially all there is at a glance. All the links seem to be working fine on the site, which leads to another question as to why so many 
of them lead to the **same** page of the background of Hester Pulter and her poems. A few links are the exception to this, and they lead to the team that runs the project, 
how to cite the project, and one that talks about recent events involving Pulter's work. Everything else goes to the same page. While I think it is intriguing to have all 
current publications of the author listed in one of the links, I do not see why that would be the most useful thing to research. I can see a lot of time was spent on 
researching the Project and a lot was found as a result. But for all the research uncovered, they spent most of the page talking about what they believed Pulter's life was like,
but much less time on the artifact they had. The researchers did not seem as focused on speaking about the book as they were about her. I believe it is important to not forget the author,
but I think that if the main tool they could use to learn about her happended to be what the project was about they could have utilized it more. I think them revealing all of the citations,
along with where to find the original manuscript, could be their way of saying that readers could read it for themselves. But they gave some information on the page that had me personally wanting more
about the book itself, such as if she colloberated with other poets or how many poems were in the book, or how long it took her to write. I have little experience researching and critiquing new projects,
but in my experience people will often do in text citations of what they are presenting. This was done multiple times on the page, but I felt it could have been done even more with citationd from the manuscript. 
It would be significantly more creative than what I could come up with, and I think overall this project was efficient, especially in naigating the pages. 
But I also think more could have been made.
